(PRODUCT)RED,the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§,30/11/2022,949.00,256GB,5.0,"Apple return to making a large version of their normal handset for the first time since the 8 plus and what a brilliant bit of kit it is.I find the cameras on a standard iPhone superb and more than good enough for my needs. For the iPhone 12 & 13 Iâ€™ve had to get the Pro Max to get the larger screen.Donâ€™t get me wrong, the pro max is a great phone but unless youâ€™re a serious photographer itâ€™s likely the cameraâ€™s never going to reach its potential with the average user.Being able to buy the 256GB version of the standard iPhone for more or less the price of the 128GB pro Max is a real yes please moment.As an avid product red buyer Iâ€™m also delighted to be able to go back to red. The Pro Max has never been available in any of the colours I like so Iâ€™ve always hidden it in a case.The iPhone 14 Plus is fast, the battery life a massive improvement, the cameras are excellent and the price point, whilst expensive, offers the average user more for their money.",Apple iPhone 14 Plus
Purple,the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§,28/11/2022,949.00,128GB,5.0,"I love this phone. I've never had an iPhone so from my perspective this item is insanely good.The screen is large, battery lasts long and the camera is extremely good (it supersedes what I had on my previous phones). It's expensive but worth the money.However, from what I understood, the refresh frame on the screen on the Plus version is a bit lower than the Pro. So perhaps if you are picky when it comes to iphones, look into that because it might bother you. It doesnt bother me at all (due to my previous phone being total garbo).5/5 stars! Love it :)",Apple iPhone 14 Plus
Blue,the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§,04/12/2022,949.00,128GB,5.0,"Really nice phone, nice screen and interest-free payments.  Cheaper than the Apple upgrade program",Apple iPhone 14 Plus
